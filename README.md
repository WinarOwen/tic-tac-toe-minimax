# Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Installation:
1. git clone  https://github.com/WinarOwen/tic-tac-toe-minimax.git
2. Run the file

## Explanation:
 Minimax Algorithm is a simple adversarial search algorithm used in a 2 player zero sum game. The way it works is by maximizing the AI's score and minimizing the opponent's by traversing through all possible game states. The Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique to prune unnecessary branches in the game-tree which speeds up the algorithm.
